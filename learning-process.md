# Learning Process

## 1. What is the Feynman Technique?

Learn something then teach others, Think like how you would teach a kid while teaching about your own learning. Use a pen and paper and write the whole explanation from the base.

## 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

How we can switch between the diffused state of mind to the active state? By relaxing for a while and then instantly switching to the active state with all our consciousness.
Salvador Dal√≠ and Thomas Edison have developed techniques to work efficiently by switching between states of minds

## 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

| Active mode                                                                                                                     | Diffused mode                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Focused and concentrated thinking mode.                                                                                         | A more relaxed and unfocused thinking mode.                                                 |
| Typically involves working on a specific task, problem, or learning objective with a high level of attention and concentration. | Involves allowing your mind to wander and explore a broader range of ideas and connections. |

## 4. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

1. While learning about new stuff we should have at least give it 20 hours of of focused, deliberate practice, to acquire basic proficiency in new skill.
2. To master that skill we should keep learning and practicing ongoing.

## 5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

While learning about new topics and processes.

1. I'll start by searching for the best material available that suits the requirement and the time constraint allocated to that topic.
2. From the beginning I'll try to make flashcards of very important topics to revise later.
3. I'll give a minimum of 20 hours of learning fundamentals to that topic.
4. I'll try if I'm able to build a basic project (basically I'm able to implement my learning on that topic).
5. At the end of the day I'll check how I'll teach that topic to others.
