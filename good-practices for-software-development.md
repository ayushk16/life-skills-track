# Good Practices for Software Development

## Which point(s) were new to you?

- The way I ask questions will determine whether they will be answered or not
  - I'll provide minute details regarding the problem
  - My tried methods.
  - Using Github gists, codepen, etc.
- Not missing calls. If I cannot talk immediately, I'll receive the call and inform them I'll call back in 5 minutes, and call them back.

## Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

Doing things with 100% involvement
I can improve by using the following ways.

- Work while working, play while playing is a good thumb rule to follow.
- Remove notifications from the home screen. Only keep notifications for work-related apps.
- Add some exercise to keep my energy levels high throughout the day.
